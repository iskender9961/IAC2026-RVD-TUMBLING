Fix velocity teleportation and improve approach physics

Major physics fixes:
- Fix velocity teleportation at t=0: reference blending now caps
  velocity changes to a_max*dt per step instead of instant co-rotation
- Fix x_B monotone enforcement: cap body-frame velocity corrections
  to a_max*dt to prevent rotation transport term injection at far range
- Add global velocity change cap in safety function (5*a_max*dt)
- Make radial decay eps range-proportional for far approach
- Restore safety projections at all ranges (removed broken bypass)

Controller improvements:
- radial_upper = r_now for r > 5m (don't bottleneck approach speed)
- Input rate penalty (weight=12) and magnitude penalty (weight=0.5)

Config updates:
- Wider LOS cone: cx=1.5, x0=2.5 (~56 deg half-angle)
- Sim duration 300s, tumble rate 0.03 rad/s
- Expanded reachability grid: x in [-80,80], y in [0.5,80], 120x80

Visualization:
- Add docking axis (+y_B dashed black line) to all animations
- Reachability maps: red forbidden zone, blue cone, green feasible
- Directional per-constraint erosion for asymmetric safe regions
- Full suite of time-domain plots and GIF animations

Results: 195m approach to 0.5m hold in 200s, smooth velocity
profile (peak 4 m/s), LOS constraint satisfied, 30 m/s delta-v.
